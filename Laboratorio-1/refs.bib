ABSTRACT = {This paper presents a method for preventing output level distortion while matching the channel impedance in the single-ended PAM-4 transmitter for memory interfaces. ZQ codes for all four output signal levels were obtained through ZQ calibration and saved in the ZQ code table. The ZQ code generator then adaptively selected the appropriate codes depending on the data pattern and delivered them to the output driver; this can improve the level separation mismatch ratio (RLM) while matching the channel impedance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, a prototype chip with an active area of 0.035 mm2 was fabricated in a 65 nm CMOS process. It achieved the energy efficiency of 3.09 pJ/bit/pin at 18 Gb/s/pin, and its RLM was 0.971 while matching the channel impedance.},
